# Classifying MNIST Digits using Tidymodels (Random Forest)
This repository contains codes for fitting a random forest model on a huge dataset like MNIST dataset. I used tidymodesls and several resources were helpful:

- [A Unified Machine Learning in R with tidymodels - Masumbuko Semba's Blog](https://semba-blog.netlify.app/05/09/2020/a-unified-machine-learning-in-r-with-tidymodels/)

- [Exploring handwritten digit classification: a tidy analysis of the MNIST dataset â€“ Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/r/digit-eda/)

The dataset is not included in the repository as Github has hard limit on files greater than 100 mb in size. It can be downloaded from this website: [MNIST in CSV](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/). Direct link to CSV: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv

This project is an original work submitted for homework assignment in Prof [Wenjun Zhou](http://web.utk.edu/~wzhou4/)'s Machine Learning BZAN 645 class at the University of Tennessee.
